# LED_Scanning_Bar
This code was used to operate a device custom designed and built to scan an LED array and test for light uniformity

The Motor_Code.ipymb file and the DAQ_talk.ipymb files both contain code witten to help me understand the API's I was using. A personal API was then built to handle any errors and simplify the final code. 

The Final_Run_Code file contains the final code used to operate the device
